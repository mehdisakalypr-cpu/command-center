## Suggested Questions
_Questions this graph is uniquely positioned to answer:_

- **Why does `POST()` connect `Community 0` to `Community 1`, `Community 2`, `Community 3`, `Community 4`, `Community 5`, `Community 6`, `Community 7`, `Community 9`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.315) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `GET()` connect `Community 0` to `Community 1`, `Community 3`, `Community 4`, `Community 5`, `Community 8`, `Community 9`, `Community 11`, `Community 14`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.176) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `run()` connect `Community 2` to `Community 0`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.118) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Are the 21 inferred relationships involving `POST()` (e.g. with `getClientIp()` and `rateLimit()`) actually correct?**
  _`POST()` has 21 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
- **Are the 19 inferred relationships involving `GET()` (e.g. with `handleLogin()` and `getUser()`) actually correct?**
  _`GET()` has 19 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
- **Are the 17 inferred relationships involving `log()` (e.g. with `POST()` and `GET()`) actually correct?**
  _`log()` has 17 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
- **Should `Community 0` be split into smaller, more focused modules?**
  _Cohesion score 0.04 - nodes in this community are weakly interconnected._
